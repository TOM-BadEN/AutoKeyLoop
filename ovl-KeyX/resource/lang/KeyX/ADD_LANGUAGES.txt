- Due to the limited horizontal space of the overlay UI, the available area for displaying text is very constrained.
- The UI of this project was originally designed based on Chinese, which has a relatively high information density.
- In addition, as the software provides a large number of features, the overall UI layout is quite compact.
- As a result, when translating into other languages, the text length may increase significantly and may be truncated in some parts of the interface.
- While preserving the original meaning, we kindly ask you to keep the translations as concise as possible to fit the existing UI layout.
- Thank you for your understanding and support.

HOW TO ADD A NEW LANGUAGE:
  1. Copy en.json and rename it to your language code (e.g., ja.json for Japanese)
  2. Translate the values (NOT the keys) in the JSON file
  3. Place the file in: /switch/.overlays/lang/KeyX/
  4. Restart the overlay to load the new language

NOTES:
  - The overlay automatically detects your Switch system language
  - If no language file is found, it will fall back to English (en.json)
  - If en.json is missing, it will use hardcoded Simplified Chinese
  - Only translate the text values, keep the JSON keys unchanged
